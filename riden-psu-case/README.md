## Work in progress

Case for RIDEN RD series power supply units.

Specifically designed for the RD6024. (should work just fine for other models as well)

Required hardware:

- XT60E-M connector
- M2.5 x ~8mm screw (x2)

Designed to be 3d printed. PLA filament. 0.4mm nozzle. 0.2mm layer height

XT60E-M screw holes and retention slot holes are drilled after printing (for accuracy).
